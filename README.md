C# Code for Project Sansar

This repository has my code I have been doing inside of the Linden Labs Project Sansar Virtual World Software.  All the programs are documented in great detail in the associated Wiki.

**Beat Blocks** - Code related to my Beat Blocks Music Experience where you can create Electronic Dance Music using a Sansar based Live DJ software that allows you to combine music loops to create music. 

**AlgoRaver** - Live Music you can create with code you type in the chat window.  Based on a previous project I worked on called Sonic Pi.

**Slide Show** - A simple slide show controller for Sansar where you designate a screen and then create slides that get called into the screen via the scripts.

**Media Screen** - This is a full featured media screen that allows you to control content on a media surface in Sansar.  See Wiki for a detailed description of it's many features.

**Instruments** - Stand Alone Musical Instruments that you can play in Sansar.
