# AlgoRaver
C# Code for Project Sansar

This repository has my code for the AlgoRaver Script in Sansar.  This script allows you to create algorithmic music using the chat window.

**gotMojoAlgoRaverV0** - Live Music Coding in Sansar.  This program uses the Chat Window as a UI to be able to control loops that play samples, instruments and other special comands.  The musician can type in commands that create a set of beats or full songs.  The musician can have live performances in Sansar using this program to create EDM Music.
